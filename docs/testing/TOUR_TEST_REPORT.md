### Programmatic Test Coverage
- ✅ **Can Test:** File existence, HTTP responses, syntax validation, text presence
- ❌ **Cannot Test:** Visual rendering, user interactions, JavaScript execution in browser

---

## Recommendations

### Before Manual Testing
1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Ensure fresh assets are loaded
2. **Clear LocalStorage:** Test auto-start behavior from clean state
3. **Open DevTools Console:** Monitor for errors during testing
4. **Test Multiple Crews:** Verify tours work across different crews

### During Manual Testing
1. **Test Incrementally:** Complete one checklist section at a time
2. **Document Issues:** Note any visual glitches or unexpected behavior
3. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Very long crew names
   - Crews with no agents/tasks
   - Executions in different states (running/completed/failed)

### After Manual Testing
1. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari if possible
2. **Mobile Testing:** Verify responsive behavior
3. **Performance Check:** Ensure no lag during tour navigation
