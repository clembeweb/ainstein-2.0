## 🔧 APPLIED FIXES (TODAY - 2025-10-12)

### Session Configuration Fix
✅ **Completed Actions**:
1. Connected to production server via SSH
2. Located Laravel installation at `/var/www/ainstein`
3. Backed up .env file to `.env.backup.20251012`
4. Added critical HTTPS session configurations:
   ```env
   SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
